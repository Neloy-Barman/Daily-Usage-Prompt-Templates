# Video Transcription to Notes
``````md
## Context
I am learning to create <subject> from tutorials. But taking down notes is costing me a lot of time. Due to that, I am making slow progress. That's why I want to automate this process. Now you need to work as my note taking assistant. I will provide you with the lecture transcript. You need to take the notes for me and return me with the `.md` file. So, that in future, if I forget the thing or want to recall the tasks to perform, I can look at those and recall how the things should be done or get overview of the video content.

## Lecture Transcript Data

## Task
Provide me with the notes in `.md` formation. 

## Rules 
- Provide with a suitable and the most relevant name for the markdown file.
- Don't mention as these notes are from some kind of lecture or video. Instead use something generic because someone new won't understand what lecture we are talking about.
- The notes should be in a format so that anyone can perform the staffs mentioned in the lecture going through your documention.
- One should get the whole idea or overview of the chapter specified in the video.
- Instead of adding whole lecture, find, summarize and add key points.
- Add any kinds of examples shown or told.
- Break down the whole lecture into flow wise paragraph.
- Add necessary components as required for example, headings, strong text, listing or others.
- The sentences should be in clean, easy and beginner friendly tone.
- The file content should be short, concise and to the point.
- You should bound to the lecture content. Don't add anything extra by yourself. 
- The response should be in .md format so that I can directly copy and paste it into my specified repo.
